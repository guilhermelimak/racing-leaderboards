* To think about
  - How's the database gonna look like
    - Game
      - Id
      - CarClasses
        - Id
        - Name
      - Tracks
        - Id
        - Location
        - Distance
        - Direction? (maybe. used in some games like dirt where you can run the same track with different directions)
      - Cars
        - Id
        - Name
        - Class
      - Conditions
        - Id
        - Name
    - Entries
      - PlayerId
      - Id
      - GameId
      - TrackId
      - CarId
      - ConditionId
      - Time
      - ReplayUrl
